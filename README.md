Mathematical thinking game

In this game the player need to crack the code of each floor in order to win. There are 4 levels in the game:

Easy --> 5 levels.
Medium --> 10 levels.
Hard --> 15 levels.
Extreme --> 20 levels.
As the player progress in the game, the dufficulty gets higher and higher. The player has 3 lives.

The numbers of the code for each level are generated randomly and the range of numbers is increased during the game, making it more difficult to guess.
